  summarise(step_day = sum(steps,na.rm = TRUE))

mean_step_day <- mean(sum_step_day$step_day, na.rm = TRUE)
median_step_day <- median(sum_step_day$step_day, na.rm = TRUE)

hist(sum_step_day$step_day, main = 'Sum of step per day');
abline(v=mean_step_day,col='blue')
text(mean_step_day - 1000, 20, 'mean')
